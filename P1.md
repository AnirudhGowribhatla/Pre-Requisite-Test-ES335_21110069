We require nxmxk multiplications and nxmx(k-1) additions.
This is because we have in total mxn repeating cells and hence we have mxn expressions in both multiplication and addition terms. For multiplication, the elements of k columns in the nxk matrix give k multiplication and we require k-1 additions to add these terms.
